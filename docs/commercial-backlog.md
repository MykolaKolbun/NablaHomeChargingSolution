# Commercial Backlog

Ideas and fixes discovered while building Nabla Home that may also benefit the commercial
solution (`..\NablaPublicChargingSolution`). Nothing here is applied from this repo —
each item is applied later, separately, in the commercial repo it targets.

Format: one section per item. Status: `idea` → `planned` → `applied (commit/PR)` / `rejected`.

## CB-001 · Configurable RabbitMQ VirtualHost and CORS origins in OCPPServer
- **Target:** `OCPP_RD/OCPPServer` (`Program.cs`, `RabbitMqPublisher.cs`)
- **Status:** idea
- **Why:** `docs/messaging-api-spec.md` §6 already documents `RabbitMq:VirtualHost`, but the code
  ignores it (always `/`). CORS origin `https://admin.alternatiview.com.ua` is hard-coded.
  Making both configurable (defaults = current values) allows staging/test deployments on a
  shared broker without code changes.
- **Reference implementation here:** `EVOCPP` commit `8130e2e`.

## CB-002 · EVChargingApi.Tests no longer compiles
- **Target:** `EVChargingApi.Tests/Fiscal/FiscalFlowTests.cs`
- **Status:** idea
- **Why:** 28 compile errors — tests use `PaymentOrder.FiscalStatus`, `FiscalAttempts`,
  `FiscalReceiptId`, `FiscalReceiptUrl`, `FiscalIssuedAt`, which were removed from the model.
  The whole test project is blocked, so no API tests run at all.
- **Found:** 2026-10-08, while verifying the folder move.
